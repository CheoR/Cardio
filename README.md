Build a [Trello](https://trello.com/) clone to exercise your development skills

## Trello

Trello is a popular application for creating lists, adding cards to those lists, and grouping lists into boards. It is a surprisingly powerful tool given it's simplicity. It can be used for such diverse purposes as managing personal to-do lists to keeping up with research topics to tracking major projects involving multiple large teams...and more.

## A Trello Clone

A Trello "clone" is an application that mimics the features of Trello. Building a Trello clone is a popular way of practicing and improving software development skills.

How popular? A quick Github search should tell us.

In general building a clone of an existing application is a good approach to practicing software development because it frees the developer from the burden of thinking up a project (and all of it's features), and allows the developer to focus on the technology.

## Getting Started

1. To get started you should first decide upon the learning objectives of the project.

    * Are you trying to improve your front-end skills?
    * Are you trying to improve your back-end skills?
    * Are you trying to improve your database design and/or data relationship skills?
    * Are you trying to improve your design skills?
    * Are you trying to learn a new technology?
    * Are you trying to practice Test Driven Development?
    * ...etc...

    > **NOTE:** You will probably have multiple learning objectives.

1. The next step is to choose a technology stack. Assuming you are building a web application, this means you should choose a front-end framework (such as React or Vue) and a back-end technology (such as ASP<span>.</span>NET or Django). You should also plan your approach to styling and decide if you wish to use a styling/component library or create your own.

1. Plan.

    1. Think about the features of your project. Here are some [User Stories](./stories.md) to get you started. Spend some time thinking about the priority of features. Which features best support your learning objectives?

    1. Design your database. https://dbdiagram.io/ is a good tool for building Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).

1. Setup your basic project structure in a git repo. Don't forget to add a `.gitignore` file!

1. Start building. Make sure you take advantage of source control (git) as you build your app. Use feature branches and commit often.

1. Stay focused. Stick to your plan. If you find yourself getting side-tracked, take a moment and ask yourself, _"Is this the right thing for me to be doing now? Am I learning and growing? Is this valuable?"

    1. Take a look at the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to help you stay focused and on track.

1. Have fun. Coding is a creative journey and creativity is one of the greatest aspects of being a human. Embrace it!
